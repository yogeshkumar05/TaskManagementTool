# TaskManagementTool
Agency-Client task management

This tool will be used by and agency to manage the exchange of information
with clients on a project's kick off phase. The agency will be able to
a) create a client’s space
b) generate a new ‘project’ which will be a custom survey (fields will 
only be texts or file uploads) and show a progress %.
Once the clients submitted all the information, the progress will be 100% and the project ‘closed’.
c) projects will have a defined deadline and automatic emails will remind the clients to upload all the required information

# Steps to run the project
